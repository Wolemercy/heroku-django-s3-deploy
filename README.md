This GitHub Action automatically deploys Django applications to Heroku. It is built on this [heroku-django-deploy](https://github.com/nyakaz73/heroku-django-deploy) action ([marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/heroku-django-deploy)) and they both have similar implementation. The key difference between the two is that this action has support for repositories with "main" as the initial branch rather than "master. You can find it on the GitHub Marketplace [here](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/heroku-django-s3-deploy).
